## Exercise 0: isupper

**Objective:** Write a function that checks for uppercase character.

**Prototype:** `int _isupper(int c);`
- Returns 1 if `c` is uppercase.
- Returns 0 otherwise.
- FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: `isupper`. Run `man isupper` to learn more.

...

## Exercise 1: isdigit

**Objective:** Write a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).

**Prototype:** `int _isdigit(int c);`
- Returns 1 if `c` is a digit.
- Returns 0 otherwise.
- FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: `isdigit`. Run `man isdigit` to learn more.

...

## Exercise 2: Collaboration is multiplication

**Objective:** Write a function that multiplies two integers.

**Prototype:** `int mul(int a, int b);`

...

## Exercise 3: The numbers speak for themselves

**Objective:** Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

**Prototype:** `void print_numbers(void);`
- You can only use `_putchar` twice in your code.

...

## Exercise 4: I believe in numbers and signs

**Objective:** Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

**Prototype:** `void print_most_numbers(void);`
- Do not print 2 and 4.
- You can only use `_putchar` twice in your code.

...

## Exercise 5: Numbers constitute the only universal language

**Objective:** Write a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.

**Prototype:** `void more_numbers(void);`
- You can only use `_putchar` three times in your code.

...

## Exercise 6: The shortest distance between two points is a straight line

**Objective:** Write a function that draws a straight line in the terminal.

**Prototype:** `void print_line(int n);`
- Where `n` is the number of times the character `_` should be printed.

...

## Exercise 7: I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe

**Objective:** Write a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.

**Prototype:** `void print_diagonal(int n);`
- Where `n` is the number of times the character `\` should be printed.

...

## Exercise 8: You are so much sunshine in every square inch

**Objective:** Write a function that prints a square, followed by a new line.

**Prototype:** `void print_square(int size);`
- Where `size` is the size of the square.

...

## Exercise 9: Fizz-Buzz

**Objective:** Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

...

## Exercise 10: Triangles

**Objective:** Write a function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line.

**Prototype:** `void print_triangle(int size);`
- Where `size` is the size of the triangle.

...

## Exercise 11: The problem of distinguishing prime numbers

**Objective (Advanced):** Write a program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143, followed by a new line.
- You are allowed to use the standard library.
- Your program will be compiled with this command: `gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 100-prime_factor.c -o 100-prime_factor -lm`.

...

## Exercise 12: Numbers have life; they're not just symbols on paper

**Objective (Advanced):** Write a function that prints an integer.

**Prototype:** `void print_number(int n);`
- You can only use `_putchar` function to print.
- You are not allowed to use long.
- You are not allowed to use arrays or pointers.
- You are not allowed to hard-code special values.
