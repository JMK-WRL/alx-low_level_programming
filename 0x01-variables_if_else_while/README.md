# ALX Low-Level Programming - 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

 *Variable: Used to store and manage data in memory, allowing the program to manipulate and reference values during execution.*

*if: Conditional statement that directs program flow based on a given condition; executes a block of code if the condition is true.*

*else: Part of an if statement, provides an alternative block of code to execute when the condition is false.*

*while: Looping construct that repeatedly executes a block of code as long as the specified condition remains true, allowing for iterative operations.*

## Exercise 0: Positive Anything Is Better Than Negative Nothing

**Objective:** This program assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it's executed. The task is to complete the source code to print whether the number stored in `n` is positive or negative.

**Explanation:** The program uses a random number generator to assign a value to the variable `n`. The completed source code should print whether `n` is positive, zero, or negative.

...

## Exercise 1: The Last Digit

**Objective:** This program assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it's executed. The task is to complete the source code to print the last digit of the number stored in `n`.

**Explanation:** The program uses a random number generator to assign a value to the variable `n`. The completed source code should print the last digit of `n` and classify it as greater than 5, equal to 0, or less than 6 and not 0.

...

## Exercise 2: I Sometimes Suffer From Insomnia

**Objective:** Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

**Explanation:** This program uses the `putchar` function to print each character of the lowercase alphabet. It iterates through the alphabet characters and prints them one by one using the `putchar` function.

...

## Exercise 3: alphABET

**Objective:** Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by the alphabet in uppercase, each followed by a new line.

**Explanation:** Similar to the previous exercise, this program uses the `putchar` function to print characters. It iterates through the lowercase alphabet and then the uppercase alphabet, printing each character using `putchar`.

...

## Exercise 4: When I Was Having That Alphabet Soup

**Objective:** Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line, while omitting the letters 'q' and 'e'.

**Explanation:** This program iterates through the lowercase alphabet and prints each character using the `putchar` function, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e'.

...

## Exercise 5: Numbers

**Objective:** Write a program that prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

**Explanation:** This program uses a loop to iterate through the numbers 0 to 9 and prints each number using the `putchar` function.

...

## Exercise 6: Numberz

**Objective:** Write a program that prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

**Explanation:** Similar to the previous exercise, this program uses a loop to iterate through the numbers 0 to 9 and prints each number using the `putchar` function.

...

## Exercise 7: Smile in the Mirror

**Objective:** Write a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.

**Explanation:** This program uses a loop to iterate through the lowercase alphabet characters in reverse order and prints each character using the `putchar` function.

...

## Exercise 8: Hexadecimal

**Objective:** Write a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.

**Explanation:** This program uses a loop to iterate through the hexadecimal digits (0 to 15) and prints each digit as a character using the `putchar` function.

...

## Exercise 9: Patience, Persistence and Perspiration

**Objective:** Write a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers, separated by a comma and space.

**Explanation:** This program uses nested loops to generate and print all possible combinations of single-digit numbers separated by a comma and space.

...

## Exercise 10: Inventing Is a Combination of Brains

**Objective (Advanced):** Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

**Explanation:** This program uses nested loops to generate and print all possible different combinations of two digits, while ensuring that each combination is unique.

...

## Exercise 11: The Success Combination in Business

**Objective (Advanced):** Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits.

**Explanation:** This program uses nested loops to generate and print all possible different combinations of three digits, while ensuring that each combination is unique.

...

## Exercise 12: Software Is Eating the World

**Objective (Advanced):** Write a program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.

**Explanation:** This program uses nested loops to generate and print all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers, while ensuring that each combination is unique.

...
