0x00-hello_world

# Directory Description 

* The directory involves all the introductory concepts used in C progrmming mainly the Compling process.

* The C compiling process involves
	1. Preprocessing
	2. Compilation
	3. Assembly
	4. Linking

# Directory Content

* **Task 0 - Preprocessor**

	* This task requires us to write a script that runs a C file through the *preprocessor* and save the result into another file.
	* The variable should be saved in the variable $CFILE
	* The output should be saved in the file c

* **Task 1 - Compiler**

	* The tasks requires us to write a scipt that compiles a C file but does not link.
	* The output file should be named with the extension .o instead of .c (indicates an object file).

* **Task 2 - Assembler**

	* Script that generates the assemnly code of a C code and save it in an output file.
	* The output file is named the same as the C file, but with the extension .s instead of .c

* **Task 3 - Name**

	* Script that compiles C file and creates an executable file named **cisfun**

* **Task 4 - Hello, puts**

	* Program that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.
	* It uses the function *puts*

* **Task 5 - Hello, printf**

	* Program that prints exactly with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,, followed by a new line.
	* It uses the function *printf*

* **Task 6 - Size is not grandeur, and territory does not make a nation**

	* Program that prints the size of various data types on the computer it is compiled and run on.

* **Task 7 - Intel**

	* Script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.

* **Task 8 - UNIX is basically a simple operating system, but you have to be a genius to understand the simplicity**

	* Program that prints exactly and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line, to the standard error.
	* The program returns **1**
