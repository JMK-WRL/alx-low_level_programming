## Task 0: Preprocessor

**Objective:** Write a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file.

**Explanation:**
This task involves writing a script that preprocesses a C file using the preprocessor, and then saves the result into an output file. The C file name is provided in the variable `$CFILE`, and the output is saved in the file named `c`.

## Task 1: Compiler

**Objective:** Write a script that compiles a C file but does not link.

**Explanation:**
In this task, you'll create a script that compiles a C file but does not perform the linking step. The C file name is provided in the variable `$CFILE`, and the output file should have the same name as the C file, with the extension `.o`.

## Task 2: Assembler

**Objective:** Write a script that generates the assembly code of a C code and saves it in an output file.

**Explanation:**
Here, you'll write a script that generates the assembly code of a given C code and saves it in an output file. The C file name is provided in the variable `$CFILE`, and the output file should have the same name as the C file, with the extension `.s`.

## Task 3: Name

**Objective:** Write a script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named `cisfun`.

**Explanation:**
This task involves writing a script that compiles a C file and generates an executable named `cisfun`. The C file name is provided in the variable `$CFILE`.

## Task 4: Hello, puts

**Objective:** Write a C program that prints a specific message using the function `puts`.

**Explanation:**
In this task, you'll create a C program that prints a specific message using the `puts` function. The program should end with the value 0.

## Task 5: Hello, printf

**Objective:** Write a C program that prints a specific message using the function `printf`.

**Explanation:**
Here, you'll write a C program that prints a specific message using the `printf` function. The program should return 0, and it should compile without warnings using the `-Wall` gcc option.

## Task 6: Size is not grandeur

**Objective:** Write a C program that prints the size of various types.

**Explanation:**
This task involves writing a C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it's compiled and run on. The program should compile and run for both 32-bit and 64-bit systems and produce the exact same output as in the example.

## Task 7: Intel

**Objective:** Write a script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and saves it in an output file.

**Explanation:**
In this task, you'll create a script that generates the assembly code (using Intel syntax) of a given C code and saves it in an output file. The C file name is provided in the variable `$CFILE`, and the output file should have the same name as the C file, with the extension `.s`.

## Task 8: UNIX is basically a simple operating system

**Objective:** Write a C program that prints a specific quote to the standard error.

**Explanation:**
For this task, you'll write a C program that prints a specific quote to the standard error. You are not allowed to use the functions listed in the `man (3) printf` or `man (3) puts`. The program should return 1, and it should compile without any warnings using the `-Wall` gcc option.
